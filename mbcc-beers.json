Generally very low yielding and more nutritious grain than modern cultivars. I like to layer complexity into all beers, using local grown ancestral grains, rather than using modern cultivars be it raw or malted.

This beer is rich, with notes of chocolate, roast, tobacco, vanilla, and molasses.","id":405,"ut_rating_clamped":"4.60","brewery":"Moksa","session":"blue","location":"1","breweryLogo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-368435_f78d6.jpeg","superstyle":"Stout - Imperial / Double","metastyle":["Barrel Aged","Dark"],"disabled":null,"live_rating":4.381060991653336,"live_rating_clamped":"4.38","live_rating_count":346},{"ut_rating_count":70,"mbcc_id":"cl0145bhg14250rsfvysno39m-4697ba09121d59025dd79032904894d0","name":"Vermouth BA Aphrodisia","logo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-4448009_219b3_sm.jpeg","ut_rating":4.25429,"ut_bid":4448009,"percent":13,"ut_checkin_count":79,"alternate_mbcc_ids":["cl0145bhg14250rsfvysno39m-62d565e55f81d0987eafefd13e35956d"],"desc":"We started with a blend of 2020’s fine California Cabernet and Syrah grapes fermented with AZ wildflower honey to produce our classic pyment known as Aphrodisia, and then barrel aged a small portion in two fresh Vermouth barrels to craft a novel mead to please your palate.

Our interpretation of this classic style is a blend of different wild ales varying from 1 up to 2 years combined with the cherries. The cherries where macerated and fermented in the beer for over half a year in a red wine foeder. We used 375 grams of cherries per liter of beer.\r\n\r\nThe cherries pop out in the aroma, together with a hint of cinnamon and almond. It’s a fairly clean aroma, with just a hint of funk. In the taste I find a lot of dark berry notes, fresh cherries, some spices and a touch of red wine notes from the foeder. The sourness is quite pronounced in this one, which mainly comes from the cherries. The beer also took up some firm tannins from the fruit. This gives the beer a nice dry finish.\r\n\r\nKriek is already good to drink during the fall, but this beer is also perfect to cellar for a couple of years to balance out the fruitiness and base beer. With a year or more of ageing, the tannins and sourness will be more integrated as well.","id":958,"ut_rating_clamped":"4.23","brewery":"Tommie Sjef","session":"green","location":"2","breweryLogo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-164204_a2dfe.jpeg","superstyle":"Wild Ale - Other","metastyle":["Funky"],"disabled":null,"live_rating":4.070081245932586,"live_rating_clamped":"4.07","live_rating_count":272},{"ut_rating_count":14,"mbcc_id":"cl1m9a04l51860qlqgu2q3ve1-d7a074ff2edd2052bb53cbb655edcf70","name":"West Coast IPA Columbus / New Zealand Rogue","ut_rating":3.875,"logo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-4795452_b532a_sm.jpeg","hops":["columbus"],"ut_bid":4795452,"percent":7.3,"ut_checkin_count":17,"alternate_mbcc_ids":[],"desc":"West Coast IPA","id":793,"ut_rating_clamped":"3.88","brewery":"Popihn","session":"yellow","location":"3","breweryLogo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/brewery_logos/brewery-278290_904a4.jpeg","superstyle":"IPA - American","metastyle":["Hoppy"],"disabled":null,"live_rating":3.6231825367209356,"live_rating_clamped":"3.62","live_rating_count":99},{"ut_rating_count":82,"mbcc_id":"cl27fza2v100120qlq64hzpvu9-eb2c2d32593a35f5a98ff2eddac1bdad","name":"Party Crasher","ut_rating":3.50793,"logo":"https://untappd.akamaized.net/site/beer_logos/beer-4677810_13c37_sm.jpeg","hops":["citra"],"ut_bid":4677810,"percent":4.5,"ut_checkin_count":89,"alternate_mbcc_ids":[],"desc":"Crisp pilsner with a light body.

We used 375 grams of cherries per liter of beer.\r\n\r\nThe cherries pop out in the aroma, together with a hint of cinnamon and almond. It’s a fairly clean aroma, with just a hint of funk. In the taste I find a lot of dark berry notes, fresh cherries, some spices and a touch of red wine notes from the foeder. The sourness is quite pronounced in this one, which mainly comes from the cherries. The beer also took up some firm tannins from the fruit. This gives the beer a nice dry finish.\r\n\r\nKriek is already good to drink during the fall, but this beer is also perfect to cellar for a couple of years to balance out the fruitiness and base beer.

What better beer than a Barleywine Ale? We brewed this beer soon after Matt left us with a group of friends and aged it in barrels that bring elements of the Man, the Myth, the Legend to liquid form. For those of you that knew him, there are peat barrels – he had an affinity for cigars and peaty scotch – Jack Daniels barrels, let’s just say 3 fingers worth in a bucket, and ex-bourbon vanilla bean barrels which reminds us of what his Jeep smelled like. Matt would have liked a Viking funeral, one where flaming arrows were shot at his boat as he floated out to Sea and the Great Beyond.

As an aroma hop, Sabro is distinguished by very clear aromas of mandarin, coconut, tropical fruit and stone fruit. To support the tropical Sabro, we used good old Citra and Cryo Pop during the double dry hop. Cryo Pop is a blend of various hops, which together provide synergy between the different hops used.\r\n\r\nFor the malt base, we used low color Golden Promise, pilsner malt and a lot of oats, for that silky smooth mouthfeel we like in our hazy IPAs.

We used 375 grams of cherries per liter of beer.\r\n\r\nThe cherries pop out in the aroma, together with a hint of cinnamon and almond. It’s a fairly clean aroma, with just a hint of funk. In the taste I find a lot of dark berry notes, fresh cherries, some spices and a touch of red wine notes from the foeder. The sourness is quite pronounced in this one, which mainly comes from the cherries. The beer also took up some firm tannins from the fruit. This gives the beer a nice dry finish.\r\n\r\nKriek is already good to drink during the fall, but this beer is also perfect to cellar for a couple of years to balance out the fruitiness and base beer.

A Pintje is usually a pilsner. There is a similarity in the pronunciation of Pintje and what the Flemish call a pinky. A Pintje comes in 25cl. Ordering bier is easy and common, usually with a light tap on the table, holding up a pinky and then the number of biers you and your friends would like, or maybe just you. The softest tap is heard, the biers arrive in correct numbers. the biers are goed, the company is goed. We normally order a Pintje at the Sporting Pigeon which has a chill vibe unless there is a soccer game on, then it is a chill vibe, too. People play a type of billiards, bingo, and cards in the back. There are Pintje holders under the table, so they do not get in the way of the cards. If you win bingo, you win canned goods of all kinds. We miss those days in Belgium so we made a Belgian Pilsner called Pintje. We curated our bar to have a similar vibe. Our bar is closed for now, so this pint will be more of the American size in 16oz cans, but we will pour it in steps in a 25cl glass at home. We suggest you do, too. Brewed with Belgian Pilsner, hops we would use in Belgium, and lager yeast. Pintje is goed. It is very goed. We are happy with it and hope you will be. It was lagered for 6 weeks, and krausened, so there is a soft carbonation and refinement we love about it. It simple and elegant. It reminds us of Belgium.

Imagine a walk in an ancient forest where thick branches creak and wisdom wallows in the wind. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you'll notice about Rust is the barrel character. Not too heavy, but woven into the fabric of the beer like a fine thread. Juicy aromas of sweet tangerine and a fresh touch of watermint create a calm, winelike structure with flavours that stay close together. Underneath are warm, malty notes that form the rich foundation of this beer. The finish has a soft echo of the Groene Bel dryhop, which lays earthy, mildly bitter notes on top of the wood tannins.

In the taste I find a lot of dark berry notes, fresh cherries, some spices and a touch of red wine notes from the foeder. The sourness is quite pronounced in this one, which mainly comes from the cherries. The beer also took up some firm tannins from the fruit. This gives the beer a nice dry finish.\r\n\r\nKriek is already good to drink during the fall, but this beer is also perfect to cellar for a couple of years to balance out the fruitiness and base beer.

Then you might get that happiness boost for a while, but soon everything just equalizes.

This beer has been brewed in small scale (5 gallons) at home in a copper wash kettle, by two brothers who were students at the time. They took over an old brewery which was out of business and said: \"If we don't bring the brewery back to life, nobody will!\". It was also a unique opportunity to create some interesting brews, so why not try it? Therefore we went ahead. We did the main work ourselves and kept the scale of the brewery as it was. Since then, the brewery and its beers have been an inspiration for a lot of brewers. Oerbier is brewed from all different malts, Poperinge Golding hops in flowers and a special yeast which makes it a little tart, especially with aging. At the brewery we have excellent cellars which have a constant temperature of 8°C allowING Oerbier to age at its best. \n\nAfter a couple of years Oerbier tastes like it has been blended with wine… Oerbier has been refermented in the bottle and contains a layer of yeast, having vitamins B.

But this beer has quite the backstory. Many years ago, we started brewing a series of DIPAs called Crush. Crush was our ever-changing concept, idea, and journey towards the perfect DIPA in a world where our vision of the ideal DIPA was ever-changing. Having brewed the Crush series for a couple of years, in 2018, we started to brew beer in the USA. Mostly hoppy stuff because hoppy stuff doesn’t travel well. And we wanted to offer the consumer fresh, hoppy Dugges beers. Deciding on what to brew there was easy. We just lifted the Crush series overseas and started playing around with them there. The response was overwhelming, so we knew we needed to take the American varieties home. And so we did. Now, Prime is not one of those varieties or part of the Crush series. But, it is all that we’ve learned from dreaming up and brewing DIPAs. And it’s a good starting point for, once again, aiming at that ever-changing perfect DIPA. Also, it’s the first-ever Dugges beer in a 500ml can. Can-tastic!
